# Classifying-embeddings-with-keras


This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use embeddings produced by the Gemini API to classify newsgroup posts into their respective categories using Keras. The notebook shows how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the model training process, enabling high-quality classification without the need to train from scratch on raw text data.

# Key Highlights:

Embeddings with Gemini API: Uses the Gemini API to generate embeddings for newsgroup posts, which serve as input for training a classifier.

Keras for Classification: Demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a classification model in Keras using embeddings instead of raw text.

Reduced Training Complexity: By leveraging embeddings, the notebook avoids the complexities of training directly on text input, allowing effective classification with fewer training examples.

Hands-on Learning: Designed to provide practical experience with embeddings and Keras for machine learning tasks.

# Setup Instructions:

Requires a valid Google API key stored as a Kaggle secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY.

Refer to the linked FAQ and troubleshooting guide for common setup issues.

# Requirements:

Python environment with TensorFlow and Keras installed.

Access to the Gemini API for embeddings generation.

This notebook is ideal for those looking to understand how to use embeddings in deep learning workflows to achieve effective text classification.
